Liberty Eiffel wrappers for the Gobject introspection library.

These wrappers are a little special since they are used in the forthcoming tool
leggow, Liberty Eiffel Generator of GObject Wrappers. In fact the introspection
library is written with GObject itself. Trying to generate the wrappers for
this introspection library with leggow would require a circular dependency so
the low level wrappers are generated using the generic wrappers-generatos and
the high-level ones, the classes actually used during usual programming are
written and maintained entirely manually.

Here there is also the low-level wrappers of GLib-Object as they are necessary
to write a self-contained tool, again to avoid circular dependencies
